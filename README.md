When the planner is launched, the first thing the suer sees is the title of the planner. 

They then look at the plannner and realize that the colors are cooresponding to the current time per timeslot.  If the colors are grey, they are in the past, they are green if theyre in the future, and it is red if it is the present hour.  

The user is able to type in every timeslot, and save the data typed by clicking the button to the right.
